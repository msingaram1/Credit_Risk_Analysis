# Credit_Risk_Analysis

### Analysis Overview
Several machine learning models were analyzed to evaluate credit risk. 
Specifically, we

 1. Oversampled the data using the RandomOverSampler and SMOTE algorithms.
 2. Undersampled the data using the ClusterCentroids algorithm
 3. Used a Combinatorial Approach of over and undersampling using the SMOTEENN algorithm
 4. Compare two machine learning models that reduce bias, BalancedRandomForestClassifier and     EasyEnsembleClassifier

After evaluating all these options we will make a recommendation on which method to use. 

### Results
